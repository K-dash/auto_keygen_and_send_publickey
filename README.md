# auto_keygen_and_send_publickey

## What is this?
This is a script that automates the following processes necessary for public key authentication via ssh to a remote server.

## Prerequisites
- Public key authentication must be enabled in the sshd of the remote server.
- The `ssh-copy-id` command must be available.

## Workflow
1. Generate a key pair on the client machine.
2. Transfer and register the public key to the remote host from the client machine (using the ssh-copy-id command).
3. Register the information of the generated private key in ~/.ssh/config.d/ (to configure for connecting with just ssh <remote host name>).

â€» The config file will be automatically generated by this script.

## How to Use
